    "## Motivation and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When quantifying quality features, researchers usually ask the participants to rate the level as scores. For example, rate the difficulty level from 0 - 5; or rate choose the best fit of your feelings from \"Strongly Disagree\", \"Neutural\" and \"Strongly Agree\" and etc. I believe that people with different personalities would have different standards while selecting among options witout clear and uniform definitions.  \n",
    "In this project, I would like to learn the relationship between individual personalities and preferences. This would be practical and useful in improving recommendation systems."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Nguyen, et al's study of \"User Personality and User Satisfaction with Recommender Systems\" shows that individual users’ preferences for the level of diversity, popularity, and serendipity in recommendation lists cannot be inferred from their ratings alone. After assessing users’ personality traits using the Ten-item Personality Inventory (TIPI), they also found that users with different personalities have different preferences for these three recommendation properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also research on the relationship between language and personalities for example [Language Models and Automated Personality Prediction](https://github.com/yashsmehta/personality-prediction).\n",

    "The dataset contains two files `2018-personality-data.csv` and `2018_ratings.csv`. The personality data assessed over 1800 users’ personality traits using the Five-item Personality Inventory. And the rating data records user ratings of levels of diversity, popularity, and serendipity of a given list of movies. This data was originally collected for training reccomendation systems based on user personality traits so it is very suitable for addressing my research goal. \n",

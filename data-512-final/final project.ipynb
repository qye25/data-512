    "When quantifying quality features, researchers usually ask the participants to rate the level as scores. For example, rate the difficulty level from 0 - 5; or rate choose the best fit of your feelings from \"Strongly Disagree\", \"Neutural\" and \"Strongly Agree\" and etc. I believe that people with different personalities would have different standards while selecting among options witout clear and uniform definitions.  \n",
    "In this project, I would like to learn the relationship between individual personalities and preferences. This would be practical and useful in improving recommendation systems."

    "The dataset contains two files `2018-personality-data.csv` and `2018_ratings.csv`. The personality data assessed over 1800 usersâ€™ personality traits using the Ten-item Personality Inventory (TIPI). And the rating data records user ratings of levels of diversity, popularity, and serendipity of a given list of movies. This data was originally collected for training reccomendation systems based on user personality traits so it is very suitable for addressing my research goal. \n",
